Create two new sheets, titled "onlyI" and "onlyT", effectively separating the members working alone and the members working in teams. To do this, filter the "data' sheet by column H and select only the "an" rows. This can then be pasted into the "onlyI" sheet while selecting everything and then deselecting the "an" rows results in the teams, which can be pasted into the "onlyT" sheet. 

In the "onlyT" sheet, use the built in sheets function to remove duplicates based on column H. The rationale for this column is that no matter the order in which names were inputted into the team members' answer space, the alphabetized reordering should be consistent among submissions from the same team. Removing those duplicates will remove the multiple times team members inputted their data, and loookup can be used later to retrieve team data.
